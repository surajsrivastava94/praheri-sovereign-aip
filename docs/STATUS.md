# Praheri — Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-06-26
**Overall:** ✅ **Full functional build complete.** All 7 playbook phases shipped (U0–U16), 52 tests passing, MVP checkpoint tagged. Remaining work is rehearsal + pitch deck design, not code.

## Milestone shipped

- **20 commits** on `main`, tag **`mvp-checkpoint`** at the U7 end-to-end path.
- Working modules: `praheri/{models,generate,store,agent,policy_rag,governance,sovereignty,models_procurement}.py`, `app/streamlit_app.py`.
- Docs: `docs/demo_script.md`, `docs/DECK_OUTLINE.md`, plan at `docs/plans/2026-06-25-001-feat-praheri-sovereign-aip-build-plan.md`.
- Tests: `tests/` — 52 passing (live tests need Ollama running).
- **Project root is now `~/Praheri-AIP/`** (moved up out of `Cowork-Brainstorm/praheri-starter/`). `Cowork-Brainstorm/` is reference-only (Build Bible source + starter zip) and gitignored. `.venv` recreated at the new path; suite re-verified green.

## Key decisions

- **KTD-1 — Hybrid investigation pipeline.** Python does deterministic triage + ring traversal + typology-signal detection; Llama classifies, decides CLEAR/ESCALATE/FILE, and drafts the STR. Plus a separate genuine model-driven tool loop ("Ask Praheri"). Chosen because `llama3.1:8b` fabricates tool args and hedges on patterns it must derive from raw rows — proven live. More demo-stable AND more faithful to a real auditable AML engine; matches the 70B production story downscaled.
- **KTD-2 — Golden cache** per alert_id (`demo_cache/`) for 1ms crash-proof hero replay, with an honest Live/Cached badge.
- **U8 — Local embeddings** via Ollama `nomic-embed-text` (not Chroma's default ONNX, which downloads a model) — keeps airplane-mode airtight.
- **Detection is code, not the model.** `compute_signals()` queries the store directly for structuring/circular/shared-device signatures. Stronger sovereignty story (auditable logic, not a black box) and reliable FILE recommendations.

## Open questions / known issues

- **`PENDING` approvals are in-memory** — a Streamlit restart clears them. Fine for a single demo session; the `audit_log.jsonl` is the durable record. (Documented in the plan, U11.)
- **DB mutates during demo** — proposing/approving a freeze sets an account to `frozen` in `praheri.db`. Re-run `python -m praheri.generate` between rehearsals to reset (in the demo checklist).
- **3 harmless chromadb deprecation warnings** (`get_config()` on the embedding function) — cosmetic, no action needed.
- **No git remote** — local-only repo; nothing to push.

## What's next (next session focus)

**Run the demo.** Walk the full 3-min flow live in the browser following `docs/demo_script.md`:
1. Pre-demo checklist: warm Ollama, `python -m praheri.generate` (fresh data), prime the golden cache.
2. End-to-end: Alert Queue → Investigate `ALERT-R001` → ring lights up → STR → propose freeze → MLRO approve → audit entry → sovereignty check → procurement tab.
3. Eyeball the tabs not yet clicked: Approvals→Audit, Procurement (over-budget PO), OAG-vs-RAG expander.

Then (after the demo runs clean): record the backup video, build the deck from `docs/DECK_OUTLINE.md`, rehearse Q&A (BUILD_BIBLE §12).
